        RAE became part of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). In 2001, it was 
        split into QinetiQ, a wholly commercial arm, and a smaller Defence Science and Technology 
        Group (DSTL), which was retained by the UK Government. Bruce was selected for DSTL 
        because of his international government connections and continued to work as a consultant 
        on all weather activities. He experienced sea time on trials with the Canadian Navy, the USN 
        and the RN and to the Naval Systems Department at Portsdown, near Portsmouth to work on 
        embarked UAV launch and recovery operations.
